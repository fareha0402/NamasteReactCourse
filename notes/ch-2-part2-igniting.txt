**** Ignite app using parcel ***
1. after installing parcel use parcel to build and serve th eapplication
2.npx parcel index.html-- command will start the application and server is up localhost:1234
3.Parcel,webpack , vite are the bundlers that make our app fast
4.Parcel is a beast that gives muscles to our project(skeleton)
5*** CDN link vs npm depencies
6. We have used CDN links to used React and react DOM now that we have npn we can install 
react and react dom from npm as dependency
7 ** Disadvantages of using react CDN links**
--We are making a resource call to www.unpk
--suppose in future ver 18 is changesd we will have to keep updating url
-- We are depending on CDN server
--
*** Error of script type="module" ***
not a js script but a module -- react is coming from node modules
Browsers script cannot have imports and exports
*** Parcel and it's feature ***
Parecel is using other dependency/packages
eg: ministry
Making an app production ready
---HOT replacement module-HMR( as soon as we change and save the file it reloads app)
-uses file watching algo(c++)
-- dev build 
-local server for you
--caching things - faster builds
--.parcel-cache(files binary , caching so builds  are faster)
--Image optimization

****Production build**
npx parcel build index.html
dist -- build 
compressed and minified html,css,js files -- production ready compressed
tree shaking, compressed, minified
***BrowserList**--
-- parcel-cache and dist can be regenrated so no need to push on git
---Parcel -- powers
--transitive depencies
-- Why react apps are fast???
