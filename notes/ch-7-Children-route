To keep track of header when routing
we lose the control of header
** so we use children routes **

if - path is /- body
if -path is /about - 
if - path is /contact -load contact us

so Outlet is the <Outlet/> is atunnel so all the components based on path it loads the component
-- Never use anchor tag to navigate --> whole page got refreshed\\
-- always use<Link> -- page is not reloaded- not refresjhed -- so the navigation is super smooth

That is why React app - is known as SPA single page application
only components are loaded in index.html
in single page all the components are loaded --> never page is changed or reload/refresh


***Two types of Routing**
1.Client side Routing (
here we are not making any network call to load the page
We have all the componnets -> no network call to show the html
only api calls to get datda-- so React is Clinet side Routing
)
2.Serve side Routing(
    we have index.html, contact.html, about.html --> 
    when we click on links we make a network call and page comes from server
)
