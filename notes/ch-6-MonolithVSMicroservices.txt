How to make API call
We don't want to use mock data

**** 2 approaches how web app makes API call **

1. PAGE LOADS --> API CALL --> RENDER UI 
2. PAGE LOADS --> RENDER UI --> API CALL --> RE-RENDER UI ( REACT FOLLOWS THIS) -- why???

better UX , better approach is 2nd
because page is frozen in 1st approach
so in second we render skeleton -- user experience is better
we are rendering twice - no impact as react renders fast


fetch is given to us by browser 
will fetch datad from api
Can we use swiggy's api to get data on fly from server using fetch
use fetch to make api call
2 ways:
then and catch
async and await -- better

CORS error

if my list is empty -->
we use spinner and loading is done
Showing spinner is not a good way it's broken experience UX --

Currently used in industry
*** Shimmer UI ---> mock UI rendered whiel api call is beingmade and UI and data is updated
We load a fake page/skeleton till the actual page loads
Meanwhile api returns data --> so user can anticipate what will be loaded
(youtube and swiggy use Shimmer UI)

as soon a page loads , user sees Shimmer UI, user will anticipate that cards will be coming
user won't get impression that website is slow

*** Conditional Rendering** 
if list is empty then return Shimmer uI otherwise load component
