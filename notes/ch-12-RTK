RTK- Redux Tool KIT
--- Reading document is Super power of developer
--- Card (Add to card feature)
-- Architechture of RTK
Redux store is a big object which is kept in global central place. 
- we can have a lot of data inside the store - yes
but to keep it managable we have SLices
--SLICES(Why we need and what it is)
-- (for logical partition)
- card slice
- user slice
You cannot modify the slice
- we have to dispatch an action- it calls a function (known as Reducer function)
**** so when we click on add button - an action will be dispachted and it calls the reducer function , which updates th eslice of redux store. ***
(A_D_R_S)
-- Write data
(A-D-R-S)
-- Read data
for that we use something known as Selector,(phenomena is known as Subscribing to store)

## install - RTK and react redux
// Build store -in utils
// Export store
//provide store to application
// RTK - helps with redux and react-redux is used for react 
// create cart slice
// we will export actions and slice reducer
//  now how to read the data from store
// to read items from stroe we use hook called useSelector
// Subscribe to store
// onClick={handleClick} // function defination will be replaced here
// onClick={() => {handleClick(item)} // calling call back function with item
onClick={handleClick(item)} // calling function
