** React uses reconciliation algorithm is aka React fibre( new way react 16)**
HOW it's done
-- suppose dom has 9 res cards (Previous VDOM)--> Ui Button Clicked  --> 3 res cards (Update dVDOm) 
VDOM 
- is representation of actual DOM ( normal JS nested objects) --> React Element --> React.createElement
console.log(<Body/>) 
Actual dom is html dom tags
--
**Diff algo finds difference between 2 Vdom
updated and previous
9-3 = 6 nodes difference between VDOM
then actual dom is updated 

Findind difference betwee HTM is tough 
Finding difference between Objects is fast so VDOM makes React fast and update UI

**Why React is fast
-- Diff algo
-- VDOM
--it finds the differnece between VDOM and update  the UI
