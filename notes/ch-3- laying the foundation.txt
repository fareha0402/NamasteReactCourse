*** to execute the project **
command
npm parcel index.html
a dev build will get created and serve in local server
Production and dev build is different so the commands
*** Creating scripts to run the app ***
** Tips to start the project **
-- in package.json
-- script commands
--- npm will execute npm run serve, npm run start, npm run build serve in dev mode , build
--- npm start is same as npm run start , behind the scences npm commans will run
*** JSX ***

--JSX is html/xml like syntax used in react not html inside js
--jsx is a different syntax
--fundamental difference bet htm and jsx
--jsx is nnot part of react
-- to make user friendly we use jsx

*** can js engine understand jsx?**
Js engine can only understand ECMAScript ES6(pure JS)
--it's not pure js so browsers and engines will give error with JSX
***Parcel is doing the job behind the scences**
---The code(JSX) is TRANSPILED before it goes to js engines --- converted to code that browser can understand
--using ***BABEL** (transpilation is done)-- it's a package installed by Parcel
--BABEL is js compiler/transpiler( converst code into js which js engile understands)
=>> JSX code --> React.createElememt -->React elememt  (object)--> html elememt(render)
BABEL converts jsx code to react.createElememt so react understands it and it gets rendered properly
___JSX__vs__HTML
class is className
attributes -- we have to use camel case
-- how to use img tag with img scr, anchor tag

** if you use multiple line in JSX we have to use parenthesis
** if single line no need
const jsxheading =(<h1 id="heading" className="head">
    Hello from JSX
    </h1>)
