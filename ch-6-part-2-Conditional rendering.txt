**State variable Vs normal JS variable***
Add Logout and login button 
---> IF we use btnName as normal JS variable
let btnName = 'login'
when we click on buttonit should update to Logout although value gets update but UI
 doesn't update
JS variable -- don't update the UI 
so useState hook comes into picture
***State variable***
const [btnNameReact,setbtnNameReact] = useState('Login')



Whenever StateVariable will change React will re -render header componet with Update dvalues
-- triggers reconciliation as soon a we click button
-- if we use normal js variable Ract wont be able to tract the change


React is  refreshing whoel header or button?-
--- Entire header is rendered again
