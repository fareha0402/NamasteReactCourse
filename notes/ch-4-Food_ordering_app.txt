---Now we start coding
** When we are repeating the code make it reusable function /component
so Restaurant card component
---**** config driven application(system  design )
Controlling the UI using the data (config) that we get from backend 
api is controlling the app / ui
live data
-- props 
passing arguments to function
--Destructure the props
** use - MAP for running for loop
** map, filter and reduce - used in react

**Body.js:9 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
*** when we are looping over list we have to ALWAYS give a unique key
** why KEY ??
-->when we have components at same level, these components shoul have uniqque id
--> WHY Key is required?
--- suppose a new component comes or gets addded to the list , Dom/react doesn't know where in dom to addded
so it will re render the whole list
--By giving them unique ID- and new restaurant come with xyz ID .. only one restaurant will be rendered instead of all 15 restaurant
-- We need to uniquely identify the items when looping
--- Never use indexes as keys(not recommended)
---it's anti pattern
not using key(not acceptable)<<< index<<<<<<<<unique id
