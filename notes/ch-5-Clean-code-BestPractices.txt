-- app.js 
single file containing everything
Best Practices 
- separate file for separate components
-all  the main code in react we keep under src folder
==Four components in one file we have
-- but code that we right is for humans
-- so for readability its better to write separate components - small files
-- Advantages of react

---- Imports /Exports
-- Default Exports(single file single export) Vs 
Named Exports(when single file you have to export multiple things)

**** Default ***
export default Component
import component from "path";
******

***Named***
export const Component
import {Component} from "path"
