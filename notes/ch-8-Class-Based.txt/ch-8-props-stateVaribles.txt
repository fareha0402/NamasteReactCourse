how to create state in class based components
- when you create instance of a class
state is created(loading class based component )
- so constructor is called - so best place to create state is constructor
-when you are invoking a function- useState(functions)

this.state is a big object so declare all teh states variable in it
- Can be used anywhere in class
update state variables
like we have setCount is functional components
we have setState in Class based components 

setState({})
-- pass the state varibales that we want to update
--only portion(find diff of objects) will be updated
NEVER UPDATE STATE VARIABLES DIRECTLY
