-- app.js 
single file containing everything
Best Practices 
- separate file for separate components
-all  the main code in react we keep under src folder
==Four components in one file we have
-- but code that we right is for humans
-- so for readability its better to write separate components - small files
-- Advantages of react

---- Imports /Exports
-- Default Exports(single file single export) Vs 
Named Exports(when single file you have to export multiple things)

**** Default ***
export default Component
import component from "path";
******

***Named***
export const Component
import {Component} from "path"


*** Top rated restaurant functionality
When we filter, UI dooesn't changes automatically if we don't use Hooks
--React is efficient in Dom Manipulation
--To keep data and UI layer consistent (in sync) -- this is the problem all frameworks are solving
So React is solving this problem- 
if we make list of restaurant which is a normal JS variable
so we need to make state variable 

*** State Variable***
State is a keyword in react
***We use react hook ---- Use state

****Hooks ***
--are normal JS function given to us by React,function has some logic written by React
---Hooks are normal JS Utility functions given by Facebook devlopers
--- We need import react hook (Utility functions)

***Hooks*** (90% time below hooks are used)
1. useState -- to generate/create state variables
-- import from react as Named import
import {useState} from "react"
It maintains state of Component
    const [listofRestaurants,setListofRestaurants] = useState(restaurantsList)
    destructuring on functionality
        const arr = useState(restaurantsList)
        const listofRestaurants = arr[0]
2. useEffect ---
